If you get stuck on a problem or a coding assignment just remember that you are learning something new. You're not supposed to have all the answers yet. You also have a lot of resources to reach out to if you do get stuck.

## Don't forget to:
-outline and draw out what you will code before you start coding
-look for an answer on Stack Overflow
-ask for help from the Udacity mentors
-post in the messaging platform to get help from peers who are also going through the same thing
-walk away, take a break, get some sleep, and then come back to it
